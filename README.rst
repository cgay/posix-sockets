posix-sockets
=============

This is a new socket binding library for `Open Dylan`_. It may
be made to work with `Mindy`_ in the future.

This library provides a wrapper around the newer POSIX sockets
APIs rather than the older BSD sockets APIs. It supports both
IPv4 and IPv6. It provides a low level binding in the
`posix-sockets` library.

This is still in the early stages of development. Contributions
are welcome, but please talk with us first.
